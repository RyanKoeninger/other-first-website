                oh hey it looks like it aligns stuff right under the image what if i make this text really long is it gonna start a new line right 
                under the image or keep going beyond it <br> damn thats unfortunate at least it indents the picture that looks better than the others

            The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult 
            as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed
             starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be 
             completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as 
             possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will
              begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
